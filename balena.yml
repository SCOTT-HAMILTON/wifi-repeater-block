  ## Usage instructions

  After flashing your device allow some time for the application to download.

  WiFi Repeater will automatically scan your network and check each device's capabilities. It will then attempt to configure the devices to work in `Access Point` mode and if that is not possible it will switch to `Repeater` mode. You *do not* need to pre configure the device to work in either mode.

  Visit https://github.com/balena-labs-projects/wifi-repeater for configuration details.
